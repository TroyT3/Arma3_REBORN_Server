<t size='1.1'>Ammo Crafting</t><br/>
    • The Ammo Crafting system was inspired by the style of gameplay used on our Reborn servers, where no ammo can be purchased. It is engaged at the new Ammo Workbench that can be crafted at your base. At the ammo workbench, you can disassemble and craft most mags. Disassembling adds components to your inventory; crafting requires them. The UI should be fairly intuitive and there are instructions accessible via a button on the app.<br/>

<t size='1.1'>Asset Management</t><br/>
    • This system gives you access to all of your territories and vehicles. It can be accessed as an XM8 app. With it, you can:<br/>
    • Toggle map markers for your base ( I removed the XM8 app that did the same thing)<br/>
    • Toggle map markers for every location that building is restricted, including other players' territories<br/>
    • Test if your current location can accept a flag  ( removed the XM8 app that did the same thing)<br/>
    • Change your base name and flag<br/>

    • Streamlined and adjusted Shipwreck scripts. Increased variety of underwater wrecks.<br/>
    • Persistent mission vehicles can now be claimed like on the Reborn servers.  You'll need a code lock.<br/>
